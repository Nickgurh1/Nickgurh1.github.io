<p>
New Zealand is a country to the right of australia in the Pacific ocean. The country is very green and has lots of rainfall
It also has many hills and mountain ranges providing a unique look to the country hardly seen anywhere else in the world.
The population is very small with the largest city Auckland only having a poulation of 1.6 million. This makes it a perfect home
for people looking for a outdoor life. There are many outdoor activities to do here from skiing to off roading and tramping there 
is something for everyone. The ocean around NZ is also teeming with life making it a great fishing location.
